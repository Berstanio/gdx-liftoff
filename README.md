To generate a project, [download](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdx-liftoff/releases) the latest application
`jar` and run it (usually double-clicking will do), or run the following command manually (replacing the `VERSION` appropriately):

```shell
java -jar gdx-liftoff-VERSION.jar
```

## Features

In addition to most official `gdx-setup` features, `gdx-liffoff` offers:
 
- **Project templates.** You can choose one of many project skeletons highlighting various libGDX features.
- **Input validation.** Your project data is validated as you type it in.
- **Other JVM languages support.** You can choose additional languages for your project, like Kotlin or Scala,
Their standard libraries, Gradle plugins, and appropriate source folders will be included.
- **Customization.** You have more control over the versions of software used by your application.
- **More third-party extensions.** Their versions are fetched from Maven Central or JitPack, so your project is always 
up-to-date.
  - **Automatic configuration for tricky extensions.** If you're having trouble setting up
  Artemis-ODB, Lombok, or several other libraries, Liftoff does some extra work, so you don't have to. 
- **Preferences support.** Basic data of your application is saved, so you don't have to fill it each time
you generate a project.
- **Optional Gradle runner.** You can optionally execute Gradle tasks after project generation.
- **Supports all libGDX backends.** Do you need the LWJGL2, LWJGL3, and/or Headless backends? Liftoff
provides simple checkboxes to add any and all official platforms, plus some special other modules.
- **Up-to-date.** This project prides itself on updating quickly when major external components update, such
as Gradle or libGDX itself.

What's more, there are no major *structural differences* between any generated projects, regardless of the platforms
you initially used. The official `gdx-setup` previously put assets in the `android` module, or the `core` module if Android is
not selected. If you don't start with the Android platform, adding it to an existing project would require modification
of the Gradle scripts. To avoid this issue, `gdx-liftoff` puts `assets` in the root folder. Adding a new platform
to an existing application never forces you to modify any of the other modules. It should be noted that this feature was
brought recently into gdx-setup in part because it worked in gdx-liftoff first.

## Credits

The project was forked from the [`czyzby/gdx-setup`](https://github.com/czyzby/gdx-setup) repository.
[@czyzby](https://github.com/czyzby) and [@kotcrab](https://github.com/kotcrab) have created the original application,
as well as a set of libraries that it depends on (`gdx-lml` and VisUI respectively). Since then, the project is
maintained by [@tommyettinger](https://github.com/tommyettinger).

[@raeleus](https://github.com/raeleus) created the
[Particle Park skin for scene2d.ui](https://ray3k.wordpress.com/particle-park-ui-skin-for-scene2d-ui/),
which was adapted to be the default skin added to new projects (if the _"Generate UI Assets"_ option is selected).
"Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino and students of MA course of Visual design" has created the _Titillium Web_
font that the skin uses (under SIL OFL license).

Other project contributors include [@Mr00Anderson](https://github.com/Mr00Anderson), [@lyze237](https://github.com/lyze237),
[@metaphore](https://github.com/metaphore), and [@payne911](https://github.com/payne911). People who haven't directly
contributed code have still helped a lot by spending their time to test on platforms like MacOS and iOS;
[@JojoIce](https://github.com/JojoIce) is one of several people who made a difference regarding iOS. And of course, many
thanks go to all the early adopters for putting up with any partially-working releases early on!

Good luck, and we hope you make something great!
