# Troubleshooting

This is organized as a list of possible messages or signs there is a problem,
followed by any ways that help resolve those problems.

This guide is brand new, and will be added to as new solutions are found for problems.

### When importing an Android project, an error mentions SeekableByteChannel.

Specifically, the error involves `void org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipFile.<init>(java.nio.channels.SeekableByteChannel)'`.
The solution for this is to install the Android Build Tools, version 33.0.2 . I don't know if newer versions work as
well, but you can have 33.0.2 installed in addition to other versions.

To install new build tools, go to Tools -> Android -> SDK Manager, SDK Tools tab, check "Show Package Details" at the
bottom, select Build Tools version 33.0.2, and click Apply or OK. Then follow the installation steps.

### When importing an iOS project, an error mentions SeekableByteChannel.

Like the above error, this involves `void org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipFile.<init>(java.nio.channels.SeekableByteChannel)'`.
This has to do with the placement of the `robovm` plugin, which as of RoboVM 2.3.19 needs to be in `ios/build.gradle`,
not the root `build.gradle`. This will be automatically fixed in projects generated by gdx-liftoff 1.12.0.1, but until
then, you can replace the top of `ios/build.gradle` with:
```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "com.mobidevelop.robovm:robovm-gradle-plugin:$robovmVersion"
  }
}
apply plugin: 'robovm'

[compileJava, compileTestJava]*.options*.encoding = 'UTF-8'
```
(Starting with the line that sets encoding, everything else is the same.) You will also need to remove any mention of
`robovm` plugin from the top of the root `build.gradle` file; this means a line that starts with `classpath` and a line
`apply plugin: 'robovm'`.
